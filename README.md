## React Fundamentals

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.


## Asset References

I haven't worked with many sprites before so had to pull some from online.

Giving credit for images used in project:

- Prop Ellr comes from an enemy in a Spongebob Gameboy game, sprite sheet can be found [here](https://www.spriters-resource.com/game_boy_advance/spongebobsquarepantsbattleforbikinibottom/sheet/84906/)
- Thought it would be "cute" for Prop Ellr to have some kind of box while not on table so that image came from Vecteezy and can be found [here](https://www.vecteezy.com/vector-art/3916593-collection-of-flat-vector-illustrations-of-cardboard-boxes-in-cartoon-style-perfect-for-illustrations-of-shipping-services-cargo-and-gift-boxes)
- From the design, I wanted to have some buttons. Luckily I was able to find some that fit my needs all from the same stylesheet which can be found [here](https://prinbles.itch.io/robin)
